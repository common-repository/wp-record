Record the posts and play them in the front end

== Description ==

Couple years ago, I entered to a post of a website which had a small audio player. This little thing gave me the possibility to hear what the post was doing while working on my tasks. So, I didnÂ´t have to spend time reading. This is what makes WP-Record, so useful... and we are thinking about making it better with some new options that will be developed soon.
